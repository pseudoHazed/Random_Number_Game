## Random Number Game
# Description
The Random Number Game is a console-based game where players can either guess a number within a given range or have the computer guess a number chosen by the player. The game offers three modes:

### Auto Mode: The game picks a random number between 1 and 100, and the player tries to guess it within a limited number of attempts.
### Custom Range Mode: The player specifies a custom range, and the game picks a random number within that range for the player to guess.
### Computer Guess Mode: The player thinks of a number within a specified range, and the computer attempts to guess it based on player feedback.
